 * Description: Write a program that implements a craps game according	 *
 *				to the provided rules.The game should allow for wagering.*
 *				This means that you need to prompt that user for an      *
 *				initial bank balance from which wagers will be added or  *
 *				subtracted. Before each roll prompt the user for a       *
 *				wager. Once a game is lost or won, the bank balance      *
 *				should be adjusted. As the game progresses, print        *
 *				various messages to create some "chatter" such as,       *
 * 				"Sorry, you busted!", or "Oh, you're going for broke,    *
 *				huh?", or "Aw cmon, take a chance!", or "You're up big,  *
 *				now's the time to cash in your chips!"*                  *
