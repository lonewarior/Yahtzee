# yahtzee
A small C project to play a 2-player game of Yahtzee in the console.

This project was created for an introductory to C-Programming course at Washington State University. The game features ASCII dice
to dynamically display dice for each roll. The program keeps track of used combos to forbids the user from using them more than once
and checks the roll to ensure that the player achieved the combo necessary and gives points accordingly.
